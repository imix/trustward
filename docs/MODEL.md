## YAML Schema Reference

### Top-level keys

Any `.yaml` file in a trustward project can contain any combination of the following top-level keys. All files are linked via `imports:`. The loader starts at `system.yaml` and follows the import graph depth-first.

#### `version:`
- `semver` — SemVer string, e.g. `"0.1.0"` (string)
- `releasedate` — ISO date, e.g. `"2026-06-09"` (string)

File-level metadata only; not part of the domain model.

#### `imports:` — list of file references
List of objects with:
- `path` — relative path to a YAML file (string)
- `version` — expected SemVer of the imported file (string)

#### `references:` — external versioned documents
List of objects with:
- `id` — unique identifier (string, kebab-case)
- `title` — human-readable document name (string)
- `version` — the version this model was issued against (string, required)
- `location` — a local path (resolved and checked at load) or a URL (string)

External documents the model depends on — a variant register, requirements
spec, standard, or SBOM. The report renders them in a References table with
their pinned versions, so a cited version can't drift from a hand-typed copy.
A local `location` must resolve on disk at load (the same treatment `imports:`
gets); a URL is recorded but not fetched. `validate` requires every reference
to pin a `version`.

#### `system:` — system metadata (first occurrence wins)
- `id` — unique identifier (string, kebab-case)
- `title` — human-readable name (string)
- `description` — free-text description used in reports (string)

#### `assets:` — list of assets
List of objects with:
- `id` — unique identifier (string, kebab-case)
- `type` — e.g. `user-data`, `config`, `firmware`, `function` (string)
- `classification` — e.g. `public`, `internal`, `confidential`, `restricted` (string, optional)
- `objectives` — cybersecurity objectives this asset must uphold (list of objective IDs, optional)
- `description` — asset purpose and sensitivity context (string)

#### `objectives:` — cybersecurity objectives (prEN 40000-1-2 §6.5.2)
List of objects with:
- `id` — unique identifier (string, kebab-case)
- `title` — human-readable name (string)
- `type` — the CIA-scale property protected: `confidentiality` \| `integrity` \| `availability` \| `authenticity` \| `accountability` (string)
- `description` — what the objective protects and why (string)

#### `components:` — list of system components
List of objects with:
- `id` — unique identifier (string, kebab-case)
- `type` — e.g. `server`, `embedded-device`, `hmi`, `plc` (string)
- `assets` — list of asset IDs hosted on this component (list of strings)
- `description` — component role and technical details (string)

#### `trust-zones:` — logical security boundaries
List of objects with:
- `id` — unique identifier (string, kebab-case)
- `title` — human-readable name shown in diagrams (string)
- `description` — zone characteristics and access model (string)
- `members` — list of component IDs in this zone (list of strings)

#### `data-flows:` — communication paths between components
List of objects with:
- `id` — unique identifier (string, kebab-case)
- `title` — edge label in diagrams (string)
- `connects` — exactly two component IDs being connected (list of two strings)
- `assets` — list of asset IDs carried by this flow (list of strings)
- `description` — protocol, encryption, or technology details (string)

#### `threat-catalog:` — threat pattern catalog (one per file)
A single object defining reusable threat patterns. Threat entries reference patterns via `ref:` and inherit their fields.
- `id` — unique identifier (string, kebab-case)
- `title` — human-readable catalog name (string)
- `patterns` — list of threat pattern objects:
  - `id` — unique identifier within this catalog (string, kebab-case)
  - `title` — threat pattern name (string)
  - `type` — e.g. `spoofing`, `tampering`, `repudiation`, `disclosure`, `denial`, `elevation` (string)
  - `severity` — default severity level (string)
  - `notes` — description of the attack and generic mitigation guidance (string)

#### `threats:` — list of threats
Only treated as threat list when value is a YAML sequence (not a mapping). List of objects with:
- `id` — unique identifier (string, kebab-case)
- `ref` — optional reference to a threat catalog pattern in `catalog-id::pattern-id` form; inherited fields (`title`, `type`, `severity`, `notes`) are used when the instance field is empty (string, optional)
- `title` — threat name; overrides catalog if set (string)
- `type` — e.g. `spoofing`, `tampering`, `repudiation`, `disclosure`, `denial`, `elevation`; overrides catalog if set (string)
- `target` — component ID or data-flow ID being attacked (string)
- `asset` — asset ID at risk (string, optional)
- `violates` — cybersecurity objectives this threat violates (list of objective IDs, optional)
- `severity` — e.g. `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical` (string)
- `likelihood` — `low` \| `medium` \| `high`; with `impact`, drives the computed risk level (string, optional)
- `impact` — `low` \| `medium` \| `high` (string, optional)
- `treatment` — risk treatment decision: `mitigate` \| `accept` \| `transfer` \| `avoid` (string, optional)
- `owner` — who signed off the treatment decision (string, optional)
- `decided` — ISO date of the treatment sign-off (string, optional)
- `attack` — ETSI attack-potential factors, used by the `etsi-tvra` method (object, optional):
  - `expertise` — `layman` \| `proficient` \| `expert` \| `multiple-experts`
  - `knowledge` — `public` \| `restricted` \| `sensitive` \| `critical`
  - `opportunity` — `unlimited` \| `easy` \| `moderate` \| `difficult` \| `none`
  - `equipment` — `standard` \| `specialised` \| `bespoke` \| `multiple-bespoke`
- `mitigations` — list of control IDs that reduce risk (list of strings)
- `residualRisk` — severity after mitigations applied (string)
- `notes` — rationale, mitigation justification, residual risk explanation (string)

How the risk level is computed depends on the `risk-policy` method:
- `qualitative` — from `likelihood` × `impact`.
- `etsi-tvra` — the `attack` factors sum to an attack potential (ETSI TS 102 165-1
  clause 6.6.3), which maps inversely to a likelihood (harder attack → less
  likely), then combined with `impact`.

When the method's inputs are absent or invalid, the tool falls back to `severity`.

#### `risk-policy:` — scoring method and risk acceptance criteria (first occurrence wins)
A single object (CRA / prEN 40000-1-2 §6.3):
- `method` — scoring profile (string):
  - `qualitative` (default) — 3×3 likelihood×impact matrix → `low`/`medium`/`high`/`critical`
  - `etsi-tvra` — ETSI attack-potential; reads each threat's `attack` block
- `accept` — risk levels acceptable without treatment (list of strings)
- `review` — the risk monitoring and review cadence: how often risks are
  reviewed, by whom, and what triggers an out-of-cycle review (string, optional).
  Rendered as the report's §6.7 section; a placeholder is shown when absent.

When a `risk-policy` is present, validation enforces the **CRA gate**: any threat
whose computed risk level is not in `accept` must declare a `treatment` and an
`owner`. Models without a `risk-policy` are unaffected.

#### `catalog:` — requirement catalog (one per file)
A single object defining a named set of requirements used for gap analysis and compliance mapping:
- `id` — unique identifier (string, kebab-case)
- `title` — human-readable catalog name (string)
- `requirements` — list of requirement objects:
  - `id` — unique identifier within this catalog (string, kebab-case)
  - `title` — requirement name (string)
  - `description` — what must be implemented (string)
  - `satisfies` — list of requirements in other catalogs this requirement covers, in `catalog-id::req-id` form (list of strings, optional)

Multiple catalogs are loaded by importing multiple catalog files. A company baseline catalog can reference which IEC 62443, NIS2, or other standard requirements it satisfies via `satisfies:`.

#### `controls:` — list of security controls
List of objects with:
- `id` — unique identifier (string, kebab-case)
- `title` — control name (string)
- `description` — control scope and implementation approach (string)
- `ref` — single catalog requirement this control implements, in `catalog-id::req-id` form (string, optional)
- `evidence` — list of references proving implementation: commit hashes, ticket numbers, document names (list of strings, optional)

| `catalog.requirements[].satisfies[]` | `catalog-id::req-id` | another `catalog.id` + `requirements[].id` |
| `references[].location` | local path | an existing file on disk (URLs exempt) |

### File splitting and merging

The loader merges content from all imported files depth-first. Behavior by key:
- `system:` — first occurrence wins; subsequent declarations ignored
- `risk-policy:` — first occurrence wins; subsequent declarations ignored
- `version:`, `imports:` — file-level metadata only
- All list fields (`assets:`, `objectives:`, `components:`, `trust-zones:`, `data-flows:`, `threats:`, `controls:`, `references:`) — merged by appending
- `catalog:` — each file contributes at most one catalog; all catalogs are collected into the project
- `threat-catalog:` — same as above; threat refs are resolved after the full graph is loaded

A single file can hold the entire model; splitting is purely for version management convenience.

---

### ID conventions

- All IDs use kebab-case: `comp-iam`, `zone-control-room`, `threat-steal-data`
- IDs must be unique within their entity type across all imported files
- Use descriptive prefixes to clarify intent when appropriate

### Notes

- The `threats:` key disambiguation: a YAML sequence (list) is treated as a threat list; a YAML mapping (dict) is treated as vocabulary and ignored by the loader.
- `version:` and `imports:` are file-level metadata; they do not appear in the merged domain model.
- All ID references must resolve within the import graph; unresolved references are validation errors.
